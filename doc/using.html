<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Actors</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
At the core, an Actor system is very simple.  An Actor is a standalone
entity that receives messages from other Actors and does one of three
things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Changes internal state
</li>
<li>Creates other Actors
</li>
<li>Sends a finite number of messages to other Actors
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Importantly, an Actor cannot access internals of other Actors, and it
should not access any globals.  Any information used by the Actor
should be passed to the Actor via a message or else generated
internally.
</p>

<p>
Actors may only communicate with other Actors by sending messages to
those Actors, using known addresses for those target Actors.
</p>

<p>
Note that messages are unidirectional: there is no required
acknowledgement from an Actor that it has received a message.  Actors
are free to exchange whatever messages their implementation dictates
however, including sending acknowledgement messages back to the
sender.
</p>

<p>
In practice, an Actor will perform some sort of application-specific
processing when a message is received.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Actor Addresses</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
All Actors have an Address which identifies them uniquely within the
ActorSystem.  The Address of an Actor is assigned by the ActorSystem
and should be treated by the Actor as an opaque value.
</p>

<p>
Actors will communicate with other Actors using the ActorAddress of
the other actors.  ActorAddress values cannot be synthesized.  The
ActorAddress of other actors can be obtained in one of two ways:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The return value from an Actor create request is an ActorAddress
</li>
<li>Receiving an ActorAddress in a message from another Actor
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The actual value of an ActorAddress is determined by the ActorSystem,
and varies with the implementation of the ActorSystem and the
transport mechanism used.  Actors may print the string form of
ActorAddresses, and they may compare ActorAddresses for equality or
inequality and use them as hash values (e.g. for dictionary keys), but
they should not otherwise depend on or attempt to utilize the value of
an ActorAddress.
</p>

<p>
An Actor can refer to its own ActorAddress using the <code>.myAddress</code>
property.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> ActorSystem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
The ActorSystem is the framework within which the Actors reside.  The
ActorSystem is responsible for Actor lifecycle management (creating
and terminating Actors) and message delivery functions.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="fig1.png" alt="fig1.png" />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.1</span> Different Implementations</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-1">
<p>
There maybe several different types of ActorSystem implementations.
Switching from one system to another can be done without requiring
any changes to the Actors that run in those systems: the ActorSystem
cleanly abstracts the scheduling and message delivery to allow the
Actors to be oblivious to those elements.
</p>

<p>
Each implementation may require a different type of addressing, but
as described previously in <a href="#sec-1-2">Actor Addresses</a> the Actors themselves
should treat the ActorAddress objects as opaque.  In addition, an
Actor cannot generate an ActorAddress; it must be given to the Actor
as a result of creating an Actor or in a message passed by another
Actor.
</p>

<p>
Not all implementations are equivalent, however.  Although all
ActorSystem implementations must support the standard Actor API for
Actors to use, some implementations do not support specific features
or functionality, and some implementations are not suitable for use
with the type of applications the Actors implement.
</p>

<p>
As an example, some ActorSystems will run Actors as multiple
threads, whereas other ActorSystems will run Actors as multiple
processes.
</p>

<p>
Another example is an ActorSystem that uses TCP networking to
communicate between Actors v.s. a system that uses local
shared-memory queue structures.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="#sec-9">ActorSystem Implementations</a> section provides detailed
information about the known ActorSystem implementations including
their level of feature support and any known issues.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.2</span> Multiple Systems</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-2">
<p>
There can be more than one ActorSystem running on the current host
system, and there can be ActorSystems running on other host systems
that can coordinate activities with the current ActorSystem.
</p>

<p>
When Actors are created, they can be created within "remote"
ActorSystems.  This locality flexibility does not affect each Actor
implementation at all: the ActorAddress of an Actor can indicate
either a remote or local Actor but the ActorAddress itself is opaque
to the Actor.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="fig2.png" alt="fig2.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This facility allows for location independence and also provides for
essentially unlimited scalability of the underlying support environment.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> External Communications</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Actors run in an ActorSystem and communicate with each other using the
message sending capability, but it is also typically necessary for the
external world to communicate with Actors to initiate activity by
those Actors and obtain the corresponding results.  This can be done
by the external system using the following operations on the
ActorSystem itself:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>tell</b> &#x2013; sends a message to a target Actor (as specified by the
target Actor's ActorAddress)
</li>

<li><b>ask</b> &#x2013; sends a message to a target Actor and waits for a
message to be sent back.
</li>

<li><b>createActor</b> &#x2013; creates a new Actor.  There is no <a href="#sec-2-2-4">Parent Actor</a>
for the newly created Actor, so it is referred to as a "top-level
Actor" and it will be managed by the ActorSystem itself and no
other Actor will be notified if the top-level Actor exits.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To the Actor's themselves the messages delivered via the <code>tell</code> or
<code>ask</code> operations appear to have come from another Actor with an
ActorAddress.  The Actor is unaware that these messages originated
from external code.

Using an Actor system like Thespian tends to be a transformative
experience in code generation.  Aspects which were previously
difficult to work with: multi-processing, concurrency, inter-process
communications and networking, scalability, fault tolerance and
recovery, &#x2026; &#x2014; all of these are handled by the Actor System itself,
allowing the Actors to focus on the primary needs of the application
itself.

<p>
The Actor model provides a higher level of abstraction than a Message
Bus architecture (also known as a "pub/sub" architecture).  An Actor
system can be implemented on top of a message-bus architecture; the
Actors themselves are completely unaware of this implementation
method.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-6-2">
<p>
Log-based architectures (e.g. Kafka) are fundamentally "pub/sub"
architectures that use persistent storage for the published messages.
As noted in the <a href="#sec-1-6-1">Message Bus (Pub/Sub) Architecture</a>, the Actor model is
a higher-level abstraction layer that encompasses the pub/sub
functionality. The Actor model therefore also abstracts a Logging
System with the exception of the persistent storage/replay
functionality of the latter.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to implement message persistence and/or replay
functionality for an Actor system by using Actors specifically
designed to provide this functionality.  The Actor model can thus
easily be extended to mimic a Logging System.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
In order to use Thespian, it must be installed in the current Python
environment.  Once installed, all Thespian features are available
within Python by simply importing the <code>actors</code> module from the <code>thespian</code>
package:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">    &gt;&gt;&gt; import thespian

<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Starting an Actor System</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
An ActorSystem is created simply by instantiating an <code>ActorSystem()</code>
object and specifying the type or "base" of the ActorSystem, as well
as any optional capabilities of that system.  For example, to startup
an ActorSystem using the "multiprocTCPBase":
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">    &gt;&gt;&gt; asys = ActorSystem('multiprocTCPBase')

More details on the explicit parameters for this call are found in
<a href="#sec-1-3">ActorSystem</a>, and the known system bases are describe in <a href="#sec-9">ActorSystem
Implementations</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once created, the running ActorSystem reference is stored as a
singleton for the current process by default.  This means that
subsequent references can either use the direct reference (e.g. <code>asys</code>
from the above) or another <code>ActorSystem()</code> instantiation with no
parameters.

Actors are created on demand and then persist until they are requested
to exit.  Actors in a multiprocess System Base are independent of the
process that created them and can outlive that process; Actors in a
multi-threaded or synchronous System Base exist within the lifetime of
the process itself.

Actors exit when explicitly requested to exit, or when the ActorSystem

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-1">

Actors can be created by other Actors or by external applications
making a request to the running ActorSystem.  In the former case, the
Actor making the request becomes the "<a href="#sec-2-2-4">Parent Actor</a>" of the newly
created Actor, whereas there is no parent in the latter case and the
newly created actor is therefore referred to as a "Top-Level" Actor.
</p>

<p>
A Top-Level Actor is created via the <a href="#sec-6-4">ActorSystem.createActor</a> call:

    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; mfa_addr = asys.createActor(MyFirstActor)

<p>
The result of the call is the ActorAddress which can be used with the
ActorSystem's <a href="#sec-6-6">ask</a>() or <a href="#sec-6-5">tell</a>() methods to communicate with the created
Actor.

Actors normally continue to exist and handle messages until they are
explicitly killed.  To kill an Actor, it should be sent an
<a href="#sec-7-4">ActorExitRequest</a> message.
</p>

<p>
The Actor will receive that message directly on its
<code>.receiveMessage()</code> method, which allows the Actor to make any
preparations for its demise, but it cannot refuse to exit and it
returns from the <code>.receiveMessage()</code>, the Actor will be killed by the
ActorSystem.
</p>

<p>
After the Actor has been killed, the Actor's Address is dead-lettered;
any subsequent messages sent to the Actor's address will be handled as
described in <a href="#sec-4-2">Dead Letter Handling</a>.

<p>
An Actor which creates other Actors automatically becomes the
"Parent" of the created Actor(s).  In the example in the <a href="#sec-2-2-2">Creating
an Actor</a> section above, the MyFirstActor Actor is the parent of
any created Supporting Actor.
</p>

<p>
The Parent is notified when any child Actors exit.  When the
Parent is killed, the child Actors are killed by default unless
the Parent indicates that they should not be.
</p>

<p>
Notification of exited children is via the <code>ChildActorExited</code>
message.  This message has the following attributes:

If the Actor code handling a message fails, the ActorSystem will

reason, Actor-based code is typically much simpler than
conventional code because it does not have the overhead of lots of
exception checking and error condition handling.
</p>

<p>
When writing Actor code, the general philosophy is "fail early";
the ActorSystem itself will restart the Actor in the event of a
failure and possibly retry the message or abort that specific

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Guidelines for Actors and their messages</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All ActorSystem internal messages are derived from
ActorSystemMessage.  Messages sent by Actors should not subclass
ActorSystemMessage, but Actors may differentiate their messages
from Thespian messages by <code>isinstance()</code> testing against the
ActorSystemMessage.
</li>

<li>Actors should discard messages they do not recognize.
</li>

<li>Actors should allow unexpected or unreasonable exceptions and
errors to cause them to fail.  The ActorSystem will restart the
actor automatically to handle subsequent messages; the message
that caused the failure will be returned to the sender.
</li>

<li>All messages sent by the ActorSystem to an Actor are derived from
the ActorSystemMessage base class.  The messages that an
ActorSystem can deliver to an Actor are:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ActorExitRequest   (see <a href="#sec-2-2-3">Killing an Actor</a>)
</li>
<li>ChildActorExited   (see <a href="#sec-2-2-4">Parent Actor</a>)
</li>
<li>PoisonMessage      (see <a href="#sec-4-4">PoisonMessage Returns</a>)
</li>
<li>ActorSystemConventionUpdate  (see <a href="#sec-4-11">Other Actor Systems</a>)
</li>
<li>WakeupMessage      (see <a href="#sec-4-7">Timer Messages</a>)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most actors can be written very simply and can safely ignore any
and all messages from the ActorSystem.  These messages are
intended to be useable by more sophisticated Actors to handle
unusual or out-of-band events.
</p>
</li>

<li>Use simpleActorSystem for easy testing (and automated unit
testing).  Then use MultiprocQueue for testing with multiple
processes to ensure Actor isolation.
</li>

<li>It is a common practice to have an Actor probe for functional
aspects of the current environment and update the ActorSystem
capabilities based on the results of the probing (see
<a href="#sec-5-13">updateCapability</a>).  Changing the existing capabilities <b>may</b>
result in all existing actors being killed, including the Actor
initiating the change.

<p>
If the probing Actor is restarted, it has no context regarding
the previous probe, but presumably the probe will return the same
result as previous, and an updateCapability call that does not
actually change capability values does not impact currently
running Actors in that ActorSystem.  Care should be taken to
ensure that the probe Actor reaches a stable condition in this
manner.
</p>
</li>

<li>Actors are not intended to create other processes or threads;
attempts to do so may create undefined behavior.
</li>

<li>Actors should not block indefinitely on IO operations; while the
Actor is running in the <code>receiveMessage()</code> method it is not able
to handle other messages, including ActorSystem internal
messages.  The Actor will appear to be frozen and this will result
in PoisonMessage delivery failures to Actors attempting to
communicate with the busy Actor.
</li>

<li>The ActorSystem is limited by system execution limits.  For
example, ActorSystems implementing actors as separate processes
may be limited by the number of processes that can be created
(e.g. <code>$ ulimit -u</code> on Unix), and ActorSystems using sockets for
communications may be limited by the number of file descriptors
(<code>$ ulimit -n</code>), the max syn backlog (<code>$ sysctl
    net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog</code>), local port ranges (<code>$ sysctl
    net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range</code>), and various other system limits.

<p>
Thespian does not make any attempt to adjust these values, and
will do its best to work within the available limits (e.g. closing
idle sockets when the allowed socket limit is reached), but the
user should ensure that the ActorSystem is configured properly
for the expected utilization.

<h3 id="sec-4-1"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> Message Delivery</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Messages are delivered to Actors on a <i>best-effort</i> basis.  This
means that under normal or even most abnormal circumstances, the
ActorSystem effectively guarantees that an Actor's send will reach
the intended recipient (eventually).  However, under extreme
circumstances (grand-mal failure of a multiprocessing system
environment, completely hung Actors, etc.) the ActorSystem may not
deliver a message; this is why it is classified as <i>best-effort</i>
instead of <i>guaranteed delivery</i>.
</p>

<p>
When the recipient is busy, the send request is queued in the
<i>sending</i> Actor's system space.  The sending Actor will retry the
send periodically.  The sending Actor can have multiple messages
queued for different targets, but each target is handled
independently: messages queued for a target are ordered but messages
queued to different targets are handled independently.  Eventually
the Actor's <code>.send()</code> request <i>will</i> block if there are too many
messages queued for the intended target.  This queueing mechanism
provides a "back-pressure" mechanism throughout the system to
prevent too many messages being held in limbo.
</p>

<p>
If the recipient exits before the send can be completed, the message
is redirected to <a href="#sec-4-2">Dead Letter Handling</a>.

<h4 id="sec-4-1-1"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.1</span> Message Mutability</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-1">
<p>
Thespian does not automatically generate copies of messages that are
sent, but sends the original directly.  This covers most use cases
and has performance advantages in avoidance of extra copying, but it
does expose a potential for leakage of information between Actors in
some implementations.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">class MyActor(Actor):
    def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
        ...
        self.send(actor2, NewMessage(...))

</div>

<p>
The above example shows a common use case where the message to be
sent is generated directly, and no longer used or referenced by the
sending Actor after the <code>.send()</code> call.  This pattern is entirely
safe in all instances.  However, if the sending Actor maintains a
reference to the sent message, as in the example below, the sending
Actor's copy <b>may</b> be modified by code in the recipient.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span class="linenr"> 1: </span>class ActorA(Actor):
<span class="linenr"> 2: </span>    def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):

<span class="linenr"> 4: </span>        actorb = self.createActor(ActorB)
<span class="linenr"> 5: </span>        newmsg = NewMessage(foo="foo")
<span class="linenr"> 6: </span>        self.messages.append(newmsg)

<span class="linenr">13: </span>    def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
<span id="coderef-changeFoo" class="coderef-off"><span class="linenr">14: </span>        message.foo = "bar"</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In the example shown above, the assertion in <a href="#coderef-assertFoo"class="coderef" onmouseover="CodeHighlightOn(this, 'coderef-assertFoo');" onmouseout="CodeHighlightOff(this, 'coderef-assertFoo');">line 10</a> may
fail because ActorB has modified ActorA's original copy in <a href="#coderef-changeFoo"class="coderef" onmouseover="CodeHighlightOn(this, 'coderef-changeFoo');" onmouseout="CodeHighlightOff(this, 'coderef-changeFoo');">line
14</a>.  Whether or not modification of ActorA's copy occurs is
based on timing of execution between the two actors, and also on the
system Base that is used.  When using a multi-process system base,
ActorA's version will not be modified because the two Actors run as
separate processes and so ActorB has a separate copy of the message,
but the <a href="#sec-9-2">simpleSystemBase</a> (for example) is exposed to this modification.
</p>

<p>
If an Actor references a message post-send, it should be aware of
this potential.  The mutation may be avoided by ActorA sending a
copy of the original message (<code>self.send(actorb,
  copy.deepcopy(newmsg))</code>), although this has negative performance
implications (which is why Thespian does not automatically perform
this copy).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
If the ActorSystem is unable to deliver a message to the target
Actor (usually because the target Actor has been killed or otherwise
exited), the ActorSystem will route that message to Dead Letter
handling.  The routed message will be wrapped in a <a href="#sec-7-6">DeadEnvelope</a>
message to indicate it's disposition.
</p>

<p>
By default, the Dead Letter handling will discard the message in

<p>
It is possible for an Actor to register for handling Dead Letters.
In this case, the dead-letter handling Actor receives all messages
that could not be delivered to their target address.
</p>

<p>
Dead letter handling should be considered as a fail-safe to prevent
messages from getting lost, but it is recommended that Actors update
their knowledge about other Actors that no longer exist and cease
sending messages to those other Actors.  One reason for this is that
the address of the Actor that no longer exists may&#x2014;at some
point&#x2014;be assigned to a new and completely different Actor; if the
original Actor persisted in sending messages to the dead Actor,
those messages would eventually start being routed to the new Actor,

If the target Actor generates another exception when handling the

Actors created by the external environment are called "Top-Level

<p>
Most Actors are created and subsequently referenced by the
ActorAddress. This ActorAddress can be used by any Actor in the
system to send a message to that created Actor.
</p>

<p>
At times, however, it may be convenient to very explicitly refer to
a single Actor in the entire system&#x2014;a Singleton&#x2014;without knowing
the Address of that Actor.  To support this, Thespian allows the
creation of "Named Actors" where the name given uniquely identifies
the Actor.
</p>

<p>
The initial Actor creation request with the name will create the
requested Actor, but the ActorSystem will remember the Actor
associated with that name andall subsequent Actor creation requests
with the same name will return the originally created Actor (see the
<code>globalName</code> parameter to the ActorSystem's <a href="#sec-6-4">createActor</a> call or the
Actor's <a href="#sec-5-3">createActor</a> call).
</p>

<p>
It is possible to create any number of Named Actors in the system,
although it is the responsibility of the creators to manage the
namespace of those Actors.
</p>

<p>
There are a couple of disadvantages to Named Actors that must be
considered relative to their convenience:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All Named Actors are similar to <a href="#sec-4-5">Top-Level Actors</a> in that they
are managed by the ActorSystem itself rather than a Parent
Actor and therefore there is no notification when a Named Actor

will be sent to the Dead Letter Handler.
</li>

<li>Interaction with Named Actors can be slower than for standard
Actors because of the need to perform global lookup and
coordination based on the name.

Normally Actors respond to messages sent to them by other Actors,

While it is possible for the Actor to sleep internally, this will
prevent it from responding to other messages and cause messages to
be queued causing eventual delivery failure (see <a href="#sec-4-1">Message Delivery</a>).
</p>

<p>
To avoid this, each Actor has a <code>.wakeupAfter()</code> method that can be
called with a specified Python <code>timedelta</code> value.  The ActorSystem
will schedule the delivery of a <code>WakeupMessage</code> after that time
period has elapsed.  Multiple wakeups can be pending for an Actor at
any single time, and the delivery of the <code>WakeupMessage</code> is
interleaved into the normal incoming message stream for the Actor.

There is no provision for cancelling a pending wakeup; the Actor
should simply ignore the <code>WakeupMessage</code> when it is received.

concurrent computational tasks, but real-world Actors must often
interact with or control the external world via sockets, files, or
other interface elements.
</p>

<p>
One way to accomplish this is to use the <code>.wakeupAfter()</code>
functionality described in the previous section to periodically run
the Actor, whereupon it may check to see if there is any pending I/O
for these interface elements.  Each interface element should be
accessed in "non-blocking" mode so that the Actor itself can exit
immediately if there is no work to be done (thereby allowing the
Actor to process new messages as soon as they are received).  The
<a href="https://github.com/godaddy/Thespian/blobl/master/examples/httpserver/http_server1.py">http_server1.py</a> file is an example of a simple HTTP server based on
this model.
</p>

<p>
The above model is fairly limited however: it is essentially a
busy-wait loop that consumes resources even when there is no work to
do, and its responsiveness is limited by the period of the wakeup
calls.  An alternative approach provided by <i>some</i> Thespian
SytemBases is the "Watch" extension (as indicated by a System
Capability of "Thespian Watch Supported" with a value of True).
</p>

<p>
When using the Watch extension, the Actor should return a
<code>ThespianWatch</code> object each time its <code>.receiveMessage()</code> method is
called.  The <code>ThespianWatch</code> object is initialized with a list of
file descriptors (from sockets or files) that should be watched, and
if any of these have readable data, the Actor will be called with a
<code>WatchMessage</code> message.  The <code>WatchMessage.ready</code> member is a list
of the supplied file descriptors that can be read from.  The
<code>ThespianWatch</code> is <b>only</b> valid for that single return from the
Actor's <code>.receiveMessage()</code> call, and it must be supplied each time
the <code>.receiveMessage()</code> returns to specify any file descriptors that
should be watched during the wait for the next <code>.receiveMessage()</code>
invocation.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/godaddy/Thespian/blobl/master/examples/httpserver/http_server2.py">http_server2.py</a> file is an example of a simple HTTP server that
is similar to the http_server1.py but this example is modified to
use the Watch extension.
</p>

<p>
The Watch extension has a number of limitations:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It is not available for all ActorSystem bases (only those with a
system capability of "Thespian Watch Supported" where the value
is True).
</li>

<li>It is OS-dependent: on Linux, any file object may be watched,
but on Windows only sockets may be watched.
</li>

<li>It only watches for "readable" events, not writable or exception
events.
</li>

<li>It implies the use of <code>select.select()</code>.
</li>

<li>There is no timeout (use <code>.wakeupAfter()</code> for this).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Writing Actors which utilize the Watch extension may siginificantly
limit the portability of these Actors.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-8-1">
<p>
There are some cases where the desired functionality of the Actor is
to actually block on external operations.  For example, an Actor
that acts as a client making calls to an external service might be
best written to block on those external calls.  When the Actor
blocks, other Actors cannot deliver messages to that Actor and
backpressure builds (see <a href="#sec-4-1">Message Delivery</a> for more details).
</p>

<p>
The effect of this blocking functionality is to regulate the number
of requests to the external service.  If the Actor performed
non-blocking requests to the external service, it could flood the
service with large numbers of requests.
</p>

<p>
The disadvantage of the blocking approach is that the Actor is
unresponsive while blocked on the external service call.  More
sophisticated methods involving internal queueing and timeouts could
be used as well.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-10">
<p>
Actors can stipulate the requirements of the ActorSystem that they
will run in by matching "Capabilities" of the ActorSystem.  Each
ActorSystem has a set of Capabilities specified as a key/value
dictionary.  This dictionary is passed to an Actor's
<code>ActorSystemCapabilityCheck()</code> static method, which examines the
capabilities and returns <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> to indicate whether or
not the current ActorSystem is viable for the Actor.
</p>

<p>
If the current ActorSystem is rejected for creating the Actor, the
ActorSystem will pass the Actor Create request to other ActorSystems
to see if any of those systems can create the requested Actor.
</p>

<p>
The Capabilities of an ActorSystem are free form and the actual
capability keys and values are determined by whatever agent
specifies them.

<p>
The current ActorSystem can communicate with other ActorSystems to
coordinate Actor activities as described in <a href="#sec-1-3-2">Multiple Systems</a>.  To
support this, the ActorSystems communicate on known transport
addresses to form a "Convention" of ActorSystems.
</p>

<p>
When new Actors are created, the <a href="#sec-4-10">ActorSystem Capabilities</a> of the
ActorSystems that are part of the Convention are used to determine
where to start up the requested new Actor.
</p>

<p>
Remote ActorSystem implementations can be different than the local
ActorSystem as long as they properly handle communications between
the two ActorSystems and the Actors contained therein.
</p>

<p>
Actors can also register to be aware of when remote ActorSystems
enter or exit the convention.  Registered Actors will receive an
<a href="#sec-7-7">ActorSystemConventionUpdate</a> message for these events.  Actors
register for these updates using the
<a href="#sec-5-7">notifyOnSystemRegistrationChanges</a> API call.

The ActorSystem implementation determines the manner in which

capabilities, but at the present time there are two main methods for
establishing a Convention:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Members known the Convention Leader and upon startup register
with the Convention Leader.  In this mode, the Convention Leader
operates passively and does not initiate or drive the Convention
membership.
</li>

<li>The Convention Leader is told about members and actively attempts
to establish communications with those members.  This is done
using the <a href="#sec-5-14">preRegisterRemoteSystem()</a> call.  In this mode, the
Convention Leader will actively connect to the remote to
establish or re-establish connectivity (until the membership is
cancelled, for example, with the <a href="#sec-5-15">deRegisterRemoteSystem()</a> call).

<p>
This latter method is particularly suited to configurations using
the "Outbound Only" connectivity mode (see <a href="#sec-9-4">multiprocTCPBase</a> for
example) where the Convention Leader is behind a firewall and can
initiate outbound connections to members but those members cannot
initiate inbound connections to the Leader.

The communications between the Convention Leader admin process and the

To prevent network overload in unexpected or erroneous circumstances,
the Convention communications uses an incremental hysteresis delay on
communications between the admin processes; this delay increases when
there are active messages being exchanged and decreases during idle
times.  The overall traffic between two Convention administrators is
expected to be relatively low volume, but in unusual circumstances
this delay may become observable.  The hysteresis delay is designed to
protect the overall environment from failure scenarios; please contact

<p>
The Thespian implementation is design principles are: correctness,
reliability, responsiveness, and performance &#x2014; in that order.  In
general Thespian is intended to be used in situations involving Actors
that communicate relatively frequently with each other, but not
necessarily with high volumes of data.  While there is nothing in the
Thespian implementation that prevents exchanging multi-megabyte
messages between Actors, the implementation is oriented more towards
low latency and responsiveness rather than high-speed streaming.
</p>

<p>
To further ensure that a Thespian Actor-based application is a good
network citizen, there is automatic rate limiting applied to the
exchange of messages between Actors.  This rate limit is currently set
to approximately 80Mib/s &#x2013; slightly less than the traffic rate that
would saturate a 100Mib/s Ethernet link.  This is designed to protect

<h3 id="sec-4-13"><span class="section-number-3">4.13</span> Logging</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-13">
<p>
The standard Python logging can be used with the Thespian Actor
system, although there are some Thespian modifications to logging that
improve the logging experience using Thespian.
</p>

<p>
The optional <code>logDefs</code> argument passed to the <code>ActorSystem()</code>
instantiation (see below) will specify the primary logging
configuration for Thespian and corresponding Actors (regardless of
where the logger is obtained).
</p>

<p>
The functionality provided by logging in the Thespian environment
possibly includes sending log messages to a central Logging actor (as
explicitly indicated in the <a href="#sec-9">ActorSystem Implementations</a> section).
This is needed because the standard Python logging is not
multi-process safe and attempts to use it as-is will result in missing
or duplicated log messages.
</p>

<p>
In addition, the Convention Manager ActorSystem receives all log
messages from any conference member that is of <code>WARNING</code> level or above.
</p>

<p>
Once the logging configuration has been specified in the
<code>ActorSystem()</code> call, the normal python logging library can be used to
generate logging.
</p>

<p>
Log output generated by Actors may automatically have an
"actorAddress" attribute added, which can be referenced by the log
formatter (in the same manner as the standard attributes such as
"levelname" and "message").  The "actorAddress" attribute is not
always present because some logging can be generated externally to the
actors; the formatting operation cannot account for this, so a
filter should be used to ensure the right formatter is specified.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">import logging

class actorLogFilter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, logrecord):
        return 'actorAddress' in logrecord.__dict__
class notActorLogFilter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, logrecord):
        return 'actorAddress' not in logrecord.__dict__

logcfg = { 'version': 1,
           'formatters': {
               'normal': {'format': '%(levelname)-8s %(message)s'},
               'actor': {'format': '%(levelname)-8s %(actorAddress)s =&gt; %(message)s'}},
           'filters': { 'isActorLog': { '()': actorLogFilter},
                        'notActorLog': { '()': notActorLogFilter}},
           'handlers': { 'h1': {'class': 'logging.FileHandler',
                                'filename': 'example.log',
                                'formatter': 'normal',
                                'filters': ['notActorLog'],
                                'level': logging.INFO},
                         'h2': {'class': 'logging.FileHandler',
                                'filename': 'example.log',
                                'formatter': 'actor',
                                'filters': ['isActorLog'],
                                'level': logging.INFO},},
           'loggers' : { '': {'handlers': ['h1', 'h2'], 'level': logging.DEBUG}}
         }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This logging configuration complexity is unfortunately imposed by the
need to select the proper formatter, but this complexity can be
captured in an auxiliary file and is only needed for passing to the
<code>ActorSystem()</code> instantiation.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-13-1">
<p>
Because Thespian instruments the standard logging functionality to
provide the Convention forwarding ability, it is not possible to use
logging from within most of Thespian itself because this can cause
infinite recursions hangs.
</p>

<p>
Thespian internals write logging information to a file
(<code>/tmp/thespian.log</code> by default) with a single backup rotation of that
file at a specified size limit.  This internal logging can be
controlled via the following environment variables that must be set
before the ActorSystem is started:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> THESPLOG_FILE </dt><dd>specifies the filepath for the Thespian
internals logging.  By default this writes to
<code>/tmp/thespian.log</code>.
</dd>

<dt> THESPLOG_FILE_MAXSIZE </dt><dd>specifies the maximum size for the
Thespian internals logging file.  There is a single backup
rotation (<code>{filepath}.old</code>), so the actual space consumed can
reach twice this value.  The default value of 50KB is
relatively small, but this file should normally not be needed
by developers writing Actors and is usually only needed by
developers modifying Thespian internals.

<h3 id="sec-4-14"><span class="section-number-3">4.14</span> Actor Code Distribution</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-14">
<p>
The Thespian ActorSystem provides an feature to specify the code
used for Actor implementations.
</p>

<p>
By default, an Actor implementation is obtained by importing from
the current environment and then passing that object to a
<code>createActor()</code> call.  When used in this default manner, all of the
<code>.py</code> sources used to implement Actors must be in the import path of
the Thespian ActorSystem itself.
</p>

<p>
With the Code Distribution feature provided by Thespian it is
possible to load specific Actor code as provided by a (possibly
encrypted) zipfile.  The zipfile can be dynamically loaded into an
already-running Thespian ActorSystem.  This provides a number of
advantages:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Thespian ActorSystem can be distributed and activated as a
standalone element.  The code for Actors to be run within the
system can be distributed separately.
</li>

<li>Actor implementation code can be protected by encryption,
allowing that code to run only when the proper decryption key is
provided.  This provides both distribution security (Python
source files are not readable by anyone with access to the
computer on which they are installed) and validation of
authorization to interact with and execute the Actor code
(especially in cases where the ActorSystem runs with elevated
privileges).
</li>

<li>Multiple unrelated sets of Actors can share the same ActorSystem
without adverse interactions.
</li>

<li>Running Actor implementations can be updated without requiring
the entire ActorSystem to be stopped and restarted.  This is
especially useful when the ActorSystem is hosting multiple
different and independent sets of Actors.
</li>

<li>Multiple instances of the same set of Actors can be running in
the same ActorSystem simultaneously.  This is especially useful
when upgrading to a new version of a set of Actors where all new
messages are directed to the new Actors while allowing all
messages circulating between the older Actors to drain; in this
scenario there is no downtime to customers when upgrading an
Actor implementation.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When the Thespian Actor Code Distribution mechanism is used in a
multi-ActorSystem configuration (e.g. cooperating ActorSystems
between several computers), it is only necessary to load the zipfile
into one ActorSystem.  The different ActorSystems will automatically
pull the zipfile from the source system to support a createActor
operations that would occur in that other ActorSystems (e.g. due to
system capabilities or actor requirements).  This mechanism allows
the following additional benefits:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Actor code distribution can be done by simply loading the new
code version into a single ActorSystem (usually the convention
leader) and all other ActorSystems will automatically update
with that code on an as-needed basis.
</li>

<li>Actor implementation synchronization.  The createActor will
automatically synchronize the current zipfile version to the
target ActorSystem before instantiating the new Actor, thereby
ensuring that the local Actor is communicating with an
up-to-date version of the remote Actor.  There is no longer a
risk that a newer version of an Actor will attempt to
communicate with a remote Actor instance that is out-of-date and
encounter version-related problems.
</li>
</ul>

The <a href="#sec-5-9">loadActorSource</a> operation describes this capability in more
detail, including security protections associated with this feature.

This method is the primary entry point into the Actor to handle
received messages.  Each subclass should override the base Actor
receiveMessage() method as appropriate.  The <code>message</code> argument is
the message being received, and the <code>sender</code> is the ActorAddress of
the Actor (or <a href="#sec-1-4">External Communications</a> endpoint) sending the
message.

The message can be discarded once it has been handled.  As

will be caught by the ActorSystem and the message may be retried or
returned to the sender as described in <a href="#sec-4-4">PoisonMessage Returns</a>.  Note
that the <i>original</i> copy of the receive message is passed to the
Actor with each attempt; if the Actor modifies the message before
failing with an exception, the retried or Poison-returned version

</li>

<li>If a module-qualified string specifies the <code>actorClass</code>, then
the lookup of that class will use the same source hash lookup
path that the Actor itself came from.
</li>

<li>It is not possible to specify an alternate source file hash
when performing a <code>createActor()</code> call from within an Actor
(only the ActorSystem <code>createActor()</code> method can do that).
</li>

<li>If the target Actor must be instantiated in a separate
ActorSystem and that ActorSystem does not have the
loadActorSource for the target Actor available, it will
automatically obtain that loadActorSource file from the current
system and then start the target Actor from that source.  This
can be used as a code distribution methodology for the
ActorSystems' environment.  The ActorSystem that initiated the
<code>createActor()</code> call with the hash must already have that source
loaded.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The return value of this method is the ActorAddress of the
newly-created Actor.  Note that this address may be provided even
before the target Actor is instantiated and is ready for handling
messages.  The ActorSystem will automatically buffer any messages
sent to the new Actor until that Actor is ready; the creating Actor
is free to send messages immediately on completion of this request
and does not need to be concerned with the asynchronous startup
aspect of the target Actor.  However, due to this asynchronous
startup, it is possible that the new Actor cannot be started at
all; in this event all messages intended for the new target Actor
will be handled as described in the <a href="#sec-4-2">Dead Letter Handling</a> section.

The parent for a Named Actor (created when the <code>globalName</code> argument

A Named Actor persists as long as it is not killed (via an

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-3-2">
<p>
There are a few issues to be aware of when creating Actors:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>When creating an actor using a string specification of the Actor
Class, the name <b>must</b> be a fully-qualified module specification
and not simply the name of an ActorClass in the current source.

<p>
While the latter would be convenient, it is not possible for
remote processes to have access to the current source frame to
load these Actors.  One solution is to use a class reference
rather than a string (but see the next issue).
</p>

<p>
The InvalidActorSpecification exception will be thrown if the
actorClass is not specified in a valid manner.
</p>
</li>

<li>Actor classes must either have been in the system path when the
ActorSystem was created, or they must exist in a loaded Actor
Source (see <a href="#sec-5-9">loadActorSource</a>).  Many ActorSystems use separate
processes to manage and create new Actors, so any changes in the
current process after the ActorSystem process is started up will
not be visible to the latter.

<p>
This is also especially surprising when modifying the implementation
of the Actor and retrying; the new code will not seem to be running,
and indeed it is not because the previous version of the code is still
existing in the running Admin.  The Admin must be stopped and restarted
as part of the new code implementation to have that new implementation
available to it.
</p>
</li>

<li>Creating an actor inside the main <code>.py</code> file run from the command
line and specifying the class object does not work because the
module to which the class is assigned is "<span class="underline"><span class="underline">main</span></span>", which cannot
be resolved by the Admin.  There are two solutions:

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Place the Actor in a different file and import it explicitly
from that file (which therefore correctly idenfifies that
file as the module context for the Actor).
</li>

<li>Create a loadable module instead and reference the actor by
a name/import-path string.

This is the method used to send a message from the current Actor

There is no response to the send, and the message is delivered to
the target asynchronously.  There is no guarantee that the target
has received the message by the time the <code>.send()</code> method returns.

sending the message to <a href="#sec-4-2">Dead Letter Handling</a> if it cannot be

This is a <b>static</b> method provided by the Actor object that is
called to see if the Actor can be created within the context of the
current ActorSystem.
</p>

<p>
The <code>capabilities</code> argument specifies the key/value dictionary of
capabilities of the current ActorSystem.  ActorSystem capabilities
are free-form and are determined solely by agents specifying those
capabilities (see <a href="#sec-4-10">ActorSystem Capabilities</a>).
</p>

<p>
The optional <code>requirements</code> argument specifies the additional

</p>

<p>
The <code>.actorSystemCapabilityCheck()</code> should return <code>True</code> to indicate
that the Actor may be created in the current ActorSystem, or <code>False</code>
to indicate otherwise.  It is free to base this decision on any,
all, or none of the capabilities or requirements provided.
</p>

<p>
This static method may also be called to re-validate the Actor's
viability if the capabilities of its ActorSystem are updated (as

<h4 id="sec-5-12-1"><span class="section-number-4">5.12.1</span> requireCapability decorator</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-12-1">
<p>
To facilitate easy specification of requirements, there is a
<code>requireCapability</code> class decorator defined which can be used to
specify that a capability must be present in the system
capabilities.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">    @requireCapability(capabilityName[, capabilityValue])
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>requireCapability</code> decorator can also specify a
value for the capability; if no value is specified then the
capability's value must be "truthy" (i.e. some expression that
evaluates as truthful).
</p>

<p>
The decorator can be repeated multiple times for a single Actor and
it may be used in conjunction with an actual
<code>actorSystemCapabilityCheck()</code> method.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">    class MyActor(Actor):

        @staticmethod
        def actorSystemCapabilityCheck(capabilities, requirements):
            return capabilities.get('Has Lightbulb', False) and \
                   capabilities.get('Lit', False) and \
                   capabilities.get('Color', 'none') == 'Yellow'

        def receiveMessage(self, msg, sender): pass
</pre>
</div>

<p>
is equivalent to the following combined use:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">    @requireCapability('Has Lightbulb')
    @requireCapability('Lit')
    class MyActor(Actor):

        @staticmethod
        def actorSystemCapabilityCheck(capabilities, requirements):
            return capabilities.get('Color', 'none') == 'Yellow'

        def receiveMessage(self, msg, sender): pass
</pre>
</div>

<p>
or the equivalent use of only the decorator:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">    @requireCapability('Has Lightbulb')
    @requireCapability('Lit')
    @requireCapability(Color', 'Yellow')
    class MyActor(Actor):

        def receiveMessage(self, msg, sender): pass
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In the above examples, the <code>MyActor</code> Actor can be instantiated
in an ActorSystem that had the capabilities of:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">    {
      'Has Lightbulb': 5,
      'Lit': True,
      'Color' : 'Yellow'
    }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that the value of 5 is "true", as compared to a value of 0
that is "false".  Any value that would represent as true in an <b>if</b>
expression is a valid value.
</p>

<p>
An example of a much simpler case:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">    class MyActor(Actor):

        @staticmethod
        def actorSystemCapabilityCheck(capabilities, requirements):

        def receiveMessage(self, msg, sender): pass

</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">    @requireCapability('Has Lightbulb')
    class MyActor(Actor):

        def receiveMessage(self, msg, sender): pass

The <code>updateCapability()</code> method is used update the capabilities of
the current ActorSystem this Actor is running in (there is a
corresponding method on the ActorSystem for externally-specified
updates; see the <a href="#sec-6">ActorSystem API</a> for that version).
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">     self.updateCapability(capabilityName, capabilityValue=None)

<p>
If the capability value is specified and is not None, the specified
capability already exists, its value updated, otherwise it is
created with the specified value.
</p>

<p>
If the capability value is not specified or is None, the specified
capability is removed from the ActorSystem if it exists.
</p>

<p>
If the capabilities of the ActorSystem are modified by this method
(i.e. the capability value is not already set as requested) then
all Actors within that ActorSystem are re-validated by calling
their <a href="#sec-5-12">actorSystemCapabilityCheck</a> static method and sending them an
ActorExitRequest if the capability check call returns false.  This
could result in killing the Actor that initiated the capability
exchange, even if new capabilities are added.  Actors may be
recreated as desired; the new Actors will validate against the new
set of capabilities.

The <code>preRegisterRemoteSystem()</code> method is used to inform the local
ActorSystem about a remote ActorSystem.
</p>

<p>
<i>This method is normally not used or needed, and should be avoided
if possible.</i>
</p>

<p>
Normally ActorSystems will communicate with each other and
automatically perform discovery, and Actors themselves should not
be aware or involved this functionality.
</p>

<p>
However, there are certain transport configurations where this
auto-discovery is not possible.  In these configurations, this
method can be used to initiate communications between the two
ActorSystems.  This method will only work for ActorSystem bases
that support Conventions (as describe in the <a href="#sec-4-11">Other Actor Systems</a>
section).
</p>

<p>
Because the remote System and the local System cannot
perform auto-discovery, the local system also assumes
responsibility for actively initiating convention membership checks
of the pre-registered remote system.  These pre-registration checks
will continue to occur periodically until the pre-registered remote
member is removed (via the <code>deRegisterRemoteSystem()</code> method
described below).  The current system will also automatically
become the Convention Leader for the remote system.

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>remoteSystemAddress</code> parameter is not a true Actor Address: it
specifies the remote system address in string format in a syntax
that will be interpreted by the local ActorSystem.  If the
specified string is not recognizeable by the local ActorSystem, no
Convention membership will be added.  For example, the
multiprocTCPBase and multiprocUDPBase system bases can recognize
"ipaddr:port" formats.
</p>

<p>
The <code>remoteSystemCapabilities</code> parameter specifies a dictionary of
the initial remote system capabilities.  These capabilities will be
updated with actual capabilities once the two systems have
established communications.

previously registered remote system.  This method is the
counterpart to the <code>preRegisterRemoteSystem()</code> method and has all
the same warnings and caveats that apply to the latter.
</p>

<p>
If the remote ActorSystem is still running and communicating with
the local ActorSystem then it will automatically re-register
itself despite having been de-registered by this method.

<p>
An alternative base class for creating Actors is the
<code>ActorTypeDispatcher</code> which extends the <code>Actor</code> base class.  The
<code>ActorTypeDispatcher</code> automatically determines the type of incoming
messages and calls a receive method related to that type instead of
the generic <code>receiveMessage()</code> called by the Actor base class.  The
type-based receive methods are named "receiveMsg_TYPE" where TYPE is
the actual type.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
In a normal Python subclass, it is possible for a method in the
subclass to call a method in the base class by using the <code>super()</code>
function:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">class ClassA(object):
    def method1(self): pass

class ClassB(object):
    def method1(self, val):
        if val == 1: pass
        super(ClassB, self).method1()
</pre>
</div>

<p>
However, this <code>super()</code> technique is not as useful when using the
<code>ActorTypeDispatcher</code> because it only looks for the specifically
identified method, which would abort the receive handler search
operation implemented by <code>ActorTypeDispatcher</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">class SubTyper3(Typer):
    def receiveMsg_ShortMsg(self, message, sender):

        else:
            self.send(sender, "Got a public short message")
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
&gt;&gt;&gt; asys = ActorSystem()

&gt;&gt;&gt; print(asys.ask(st, ShortMsg("This is private")), 2)
# Poison message trace because super has no 'receiveMsg_ShortMsg'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The last step in the above example timed out (returning <code>None</code>)
because there is no base class with an explicity
<code>receiveMsg_ShortMsg()</code> method.  Instead, the current method should
return <code>ActorTypeDispatcher.SUPER</code> to instruct the
<code>ActorTypeDispatcher</code> to continue the normal search,

                       transientUnique = False)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>systemBase</code> argument should specify which ActorSystem
implementation base should be used for this ActorSystem, as
selected from those systems describe in the <a href="#sec-9">ActorSystem
Implementations</a> section. If <code>systemBase</code> is None, this call will
check to see if there was a previous call to ActorSystem in the
current process and if so, re-use the <code>systemBase</code> from the
previous call. If there is no previous call, the default system
base is the <code>simpleSystemBase</code> (see <a href="#sec-9-2">simpleSystemBase</a>).
</p>

<p>
The <code>capabilities</code> argument should be a dictionary of capability
keys and values as describe in the <a href="#sec-4-10">ActorSystem Capabilities</a>
section.  These capabilities form the initial set of capabilities
for the ActorSystem if it is started; the capabilities are ignored
if an ActorSystem is already running.
</p>

<p>
The <code>logDefs</code> argument is used to specify a logging configuration
dictionary (in standard logdict format).  If not specified, a
default logging configuration is usually supplied.  If specified
as <code>False</code>, then no logging configuration is supplied; this latter
is useful in situations where another component is attempting to
establish a logging configuration (e.g. nosetest logcapture).  As
described in the <a href="#sec-4-13">Logging</a> section, the Convention Leader will
receive forwarding of log messages at Warning level or higher,
providing a centralized logging capability.
</p>

<p>
Normally the created ActorSystem becomes a process-wide (and
possibly system-wide) singleton instance.  The <code>transientUnique</code>
argument may be set to true to get a new, un-registered
ActorSystem.  Note that typical Python classes provide a unique
instantiation on each call (i.e. the result provided here if
<code>transientUnique</code> is <code>True</code>) but more typical Thespian
functionality is achieved by the global singleton behavior, so
that is the default and the <code>transientUnique</code> must be explicitly
specified for non-singleton creations.

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">    actorSys.shutdown()

</div>

<p>
The <code>shutdown()</code> ActorSystem method is used to terminate an
ActorSystem and all Actors running in that system.  If issued to a
ActorSystem that is part of a multi-system Convention that
ActorSystem is shutdown and the other Convention members are
notified (but they continue to exist).
</p>

<p>
As described previously, the ActorSystem is a process-global
singleton that may be a system-wide singleton, depending on the
system base used (see <a href="#sec-9">ActorSystem Implementations</a> for details).
The <code>shutdown()</code> method is the proper way to stop those
process-wide or system-wide ActorSystems when they are no longer
needed.  The decision of when to do this is left to the user; in
some situations the ActorSystem should be a long-running service
that matches the lifetime of the system itself.
</p>

<p>
If the ActorSystem was started with <code>transientUnique = True</code>, the
<code>shutdown()</code> should still be used to properly stop the current
ActorSystem, but any global ActorSystem registration will be
unaffected by stopping the transient unique ActorSystem.

<p>
The <code>createActor()</code> method is used by external applications to
request the creation of an Actor in the ActorSystem environment.
This call is very similar to the <a href="#sec-5-3">createActor</a> Actor API call except
that this version creates "Top-Level" Actors and will block until
the Actor is created and throw an exception on failures.
</p>

<p>
The <code>actorClass</code> argument can be specified either as a class object
or as a module-qualified string identifying a class object
(e.g. ~"foo.bar.BarActor"~ will search for <code>class BarActor</code> in the
<code>bar.py</code> in the <code>foo</code> directory).
</p>

<p>
The <code>targetActorRequirements</code> argument is a value that will be
passed to the <a href="#sec-5-12">actorSystemCapabilityCheck</a> to use for validating
whether the Actor can be started within the current ActorSystem
environment (see <a href="#sec-4-10">ActorSystem Capabilities</a>).  The value specified
for this argument can be anything the target Actor's
<code>actorSystemCapabilityCheck()</code> method can understand, although
typically it is a Python dictionary.
</p>

<p>
The <code>globalName</code> argument, if specified, should be a string
specifying the "name" of the Actor within the ActorSystem.  As
describe in <a href="#sec-4-6">Named Actors</a>, this name allows the Actor to be a
system-wide singleton and to be uniquely identified and referenced
in a manner additional to the ActorAddress of the actor.
</p>

<p>
The <code>sourceHash</code> argument, if specified, indicates a source file
which should be prepended to the import path when attempting to
load the <code>actorClass</code> source and start the Actor.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The source file must previously have been loaded by the
<a href="#sec-6-9">loadActorSource</a> operation.

<li>If not specified, then the <code>actorClass</code> is expected to be found
on the standard path.  If the <code>sourceHash</code> value does not match
any loaded sources then an <code>InvalidActorSourceHash</code>
exception will be thrown.
</li>
<li>If the <code>globalName</code> argument is already specified and an Actor
is running under that name, this argument is ignored, even if
the running Actor did not come from the specified source file;
otherwise the Actor started and assigned the global name.
</li>
<li>The specified loaded source file is merely prepended to the
search list.  If the loaded source file does not contain source
for the specified <code>actorClass</code> but the standard path
environment for the running Thespian ActorSystem <b>does</b> contain
source for that <code>actorClass</code>, then the latter will be used to
instantiate the new Actor.
</li>
<li>The source specified by the hash must have been loaded into the
current ActorSystem, or previously have been obtained from a
remote ActorSystem; this operation will <b>not</b> cause a query of
remote actor systems to locate the source if the Actor cannot
be found locally (the behavior of a <code>createActor()</code>
call made by an Actor itself may be different).

This method may throw the following exceptions:

zipimport format (via PEP302<sup><a id="fnr.1.100" name="fnr.1.100" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> methodologies).  The return value
is an internally-generated hash value identifying that loaded source
zipfile that can be used in subsequent <a href="#sec-5-3">createActor</a> calls to
instantiate Actors found in that sourcefile.
</p>

<p>
There must be a valid Source Authority registered (via the
<a href="#sec-5-8">registerSourceAuthority</a> method) to validate the loaded source; by
default this method does nothing if no Source Authority has been
loaded.  See <a href="#sec-6-9-2">Security Considerations</a> for more information.

<p>
Although a plaintext zipfile may be loaded, it is highly recommended
that production environments encrypt the zipFile using some sort of
encryption methodology.  The reasons for this are discussed in the

The <code>fileref</code> argument can be a string specifying an input file path

<h4 id="sec-6-9-1"><span class="section-number-4">6.9.1</span> Source Loading Issues</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-9-1">
<p>
Although the <code>loadActorSource()</code> functionality works quite well,
there are a few scenarios that can cause difficulties:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Loaded sources containing or relying on object libraries.  The
<code>loadActorSource()</code> functionality affects the Python module
lookup, but it does not affect object file lookups that would
need to be performed for native object libraries.  In addition,
object libraries are specific to their build environment and may
not work in all target environments.  If the loaded source
simply <b>refers</b> to an externally available library
(e.g. PyOpenSSL python package refers to <code>/usr/lib/libssl.so</code>)
then this may work if the proper object library has been
installed on the target system by other means (i.e. not via the
<code>loadActorSource()</code> call.
</li>

<li>Sources containing other PEP302 path importers may not work
correctly when used in conjuction with the <code>loadActorSource()</code>
PEP302 importer.  As an example, the <code>loadActorSource()</code>
importer prefixes loaded modules with the Source Hash associated
with those modules to ensure uniqueness.  This is not always
compatible with other PEP302 importers.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The <code>six</code> package (providing Python2/Python3 compatibility)
uses a PEP302 importer to manage moved packages.  This
functionality of the <code>six</code> package is broken by the
<code>loadActorSource()</code> Source Hash prefixing. To avoid this
<code>loadActorSource()</code> processing handles <code>six</code> as a special
case and <i>does not</i> prefix <code>six</code> with any Source Hash.

<p>
The assumption is that <code>six</code> is a mature and unchanging
package and a global version is acceptable for all loaded
sources (and that a working <code>six</code> importer is preferrable to
a non-working importer).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>The <code>importlib</code> package has a subtle flaw that is not compatible
with the Source Hash prefixing performed by <code>loadActorSource()</code>.
To work around this problem Thespian provides an updated version
of <code>importlib</code>; use " <code>import thespian.importlib as importlib</code> "
instead of just " <code>import importlib</code> " in Actor sources that
will be loaded via <code>loadActorSource()</code>.
</li>

<li>Loaded sources should expect that <code>__file__</code> or other internals
can be set to None.
</li>

<li>It is not possible to send a pickled message between sources,
even if that message is imported from the same file/module in
both loaded sources.  This is because each loaded source (and
all of its top level symbols) are internally prefixed with the
hash of the source they are contained in; this helps preserve
independence between loaded source modules and prevents
interference between them, but it means that the pickled object
will have a different source hash on the target side than on the
sender side.  The object should be encoded in a more
conventional format (e.g. JSON).

<div id="outline-container-sec-6-9-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-6-9-2"><span class="section-number-4">6.9.2</span> Security Considerations</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-9-2">
<p>
When <code>loadActorSource()</code> is not used, the source for all
instantiated Actors must come from the existing Python import path
in the context of the Thespian ActorSystem.  In this configuration,
it is the System Administrator's responsibility to provide
reasonable security and protection against code injection attacks
(e.g. by using a virtualenv in a protected directory environment).
</p>

<p>
In order to prevent code injection attacks from being used with
<code>loadActorSource()</code> techniques, the ActorSystem must be able to
validate the following for each set of code loaded:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The source file has not been tampered with.
</li>
<li>The source file is acceptable to run in this ActorSystem.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
To achieve this protection, an Actor can register itself with the
system to handle authorization and/or description of
<code>loadActorSource()</code> inputs.  This Actor is referred to as the Source
Authority Actor.  Any input subsequently provided to
<code>loadActorSource()</code> is first passed to this Source Authority Actor.
The Source Authority Actor can perform any validation and/or
decryption of the input that it would like to and then sends back
either an error or the authorized source in a form that can be
utilized by the local ActorSystem.
</p>

<p>
There can be only one Source Authority Actor registered with an
ActorSystem at any one time.  Any Actor can register itself as the
new Source Authority; it is assumed that the previous authorization
of that Actor validated that it is allowed to run in the system and
therefore assume Source Authority responsibilities.  Note that in
highly paranoid environments, the initial Source Authority can be
used to authorize the next Source Authority, and this process can be
repeated as indicated by the level of paranoia to further obfuscate
the manner in which the Source Authority is established.
</p>

<p>
By default, at ActorSystem startup time, there is no Source
Authority.  When there is no Source Authority, any
<code>loadActorSource()</code> input is ignored.  This ensures that all
Thespian systems are secure by default.  For debugging and simple
local applications this may not be convenient; in these situations,
a Source Authority similar to the following may be used to
automatically accept and enable all loaded sources:

from thespian.actors import *

<p>
The Source Authority registration is unique to an ActorSystem.
Different ActorSystems in a <a href="#sec-1-3-2">Multiple Systems</a> configuration can each
have a separate Source Authority that may perform different
authorization techniques.  However, as described in <a href="#sec-4-14">Actor Code
Distribution</a>, ActorSystems joined together in a Convention can
exchange sources on demand to satisfy Actor creation requests.
sources exchanged between ActorSystems in this manner are not
subject to further <b>validation</b> after the initial load on the
original system (although the local ActorSystem can choose the level
of sharing it wishes to perform; see the <b>AllowRemoteActorSources</b>
capability setting in the <a href="#sec-9-1">Common Capabilities</a> section).
</p>

<p>
This functionality allows for maximum flexibility in handling
different deployment environments:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In an environment where the Convention Leader ActorSystem is the
centralized command-and-control system and sources should only be
loaded on that system, the other ActorSystems can be initialized
with a Source Authority that rejects all <code>loadActorSource()</code>
attempts and therefore can run only sources provdied by the
Convention Leader.
</li>

<li>In an environment where all ActorSystems are trusted equally and
new Actor source can be loaded via any system, they can all
utilize the same Source Authority as loaded into each Actor system
at the time it is started.
</li>

<li>In a loose confederation of trusting ActorSystems, each
ActorSystem can load its own Source Authority to control sources
loaded via that system, while still sharing sources loaded on any
system.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is important to note that in all configurations, different loaded
sources are essentially independent, regardless of the method by
which they are loaded and validated.  The only way for one source
load to access code in another source load is by issuing a
<code>createActor()</code> request using the known name of an Actor in the
other source load, or by being passed the ActorAddress of an already
running Actor in the other source load via independent means.

This effect of this call on running Actors' ability to access the
unloaded source via imports or subseqeuent Actor creation is
indeterminate: in some system bases this would fail, whereas in
other bases this would succeed.

The <code>sourceHash</code> argument should specify the return value from a

<h3 id="sec-8-1"><span class="section-number-3">8.1</span> Actor Troupe Support</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-1">
<p>
The use of <a href="#sec-4-9">Actor Troupes</a> is supported by importing the
<code>thespian.troupe</code> file and adding a <code>@troupe()</code> decorator to the Actor
definition.   This decorator turns a regular Actor into a dynamic
Actor Troupe, where multiple Actors are spun up on-demand to handle
messages.
</p>

<p>
This pattern is especially useful for situations where multiple
requests are received and processing individual requests may take some
time to perform.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">from thespian.troupe import troupe

@troupe()
class MyActor(Actor):
   ...
</pre>
</div>


<p>
The optional arguments to the troupe decorator are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>max_count</code> is the maximum number of actors in the troupe
(defaulting to 10).
</li>

<li><code>idle_count</code> is the default number of actors in the troupe when
idle. As work is received, the number of actors will grow up to
the max_count, but when there is no more work, the number of
actors will shrink back down to this number.  Note that there may
be fewer than this number of actors present: actors are only
created if work is received and there are no idle actors to
handle that work.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The decorator usage above works very well for a simple worker actor
that can perform all of the necessary work utilizing only the message
sent to it; the actor can be turned into a troupe member with no
change other than adding the decorator.
</p>

<p>
However, an actor which must interact with other actors to process the
work requires additional modifications to allow the troupe manager to
know when the actor has finished performing the work.  A troupe member
that has not fully performed the work and is exchanging messages with
other actors to complete the work (or awaiting <a href="#sec-4-7">WakeupMessages</a>) must
set the <code>troupe_work_in_progress</code> attribute on self to <code>True</code>.  Once the
work is completed by a subsequent message delivery, it should set this
attribute to <code>False</code>, which will cause the troupe manager to be notified
that the actor is ready for more work.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Failure to set the <code>troupe_work_in_progress</code> attribute to <code>True</code>
on a multi-step actor will result in either (a) the actor
receiving more work before it has completed the previous work, or
(b) the actor will be killed by the troupe manager before
finishing the work because the manager believes the actor is
finished.
</li>

<li>Failure to reset the <code>troup_work_in_progress</code> attribute to
<code>False</code> will cause the troupe manager to never send any more work
requests to the troupe actor, even if the latter is idle.  The
troupe actor will also never be killed until the troupe manager
itself is killed.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Manipulating the <code>troupe_work_in_progress</code> member variable for
non-troupe actors has no effect on their behavior and is safe to do.

<h3 id="sec-8-2"><span class="section-number-3">8.2</span> Transient Actors</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-2">

Some actors should automatically die at some period after they are
initially used, or after they are last used.  These actors are

Actor).
</p>

<p>
Implementing transient actors is made easier by importing the
<code>thespian.transient</code> file and adding a <code>@transient()</code> or
<code>@transient_idle()</code> decorator to the Actor definition.
</p>

<p>
The <code>transient</code> decorator cause the actor to exit at some time period
after it receives its first message.
</p>

<p>
The <code>transient_idle</code> decorator causes the actor to exit at some time
period after it has received its last message.
</p>

<p>
Both decorators default to a period of 10 seconds, and both take an
optional <code>exit_delay</code> argument value that specifies an alternate time
period.  The time period should be a <code>datetime.timedelta</code> object.
</p>

<p>
Note that a transient actor which is created but which never receives
any messages does not exit; the timer for transient exit is only
started after receipt of the actor's first message.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
One of the convenient aspects of an Actor architecture is that the
Actors themselves are insulated from and agnostic to any particular
transport type: the ActorSystem provides the message delivery and
underlying Actor support functionality.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The implementation of the ActorSystem can be changed or
redesigned without the Actors themselves needing to change.
</li>

<li>Different implementations can be chosen for different circumstances
to meet the needs of that particular circumstance.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Actors themselves interact with the ActorSystem via the normal
<code>.send()</code>, <code>.createActor()</code>, <code>.receiveMessage()</code> methods defined for
the Actor.
</p>

<p>
The external environment can interact with the Actors by making
requests via the ActorSystem object itself.  In addition, the
ActorSystem must be initially created to provide an environment for
all Actors that are subsequently run within that ActorSystem; this
creation is the responsibility of code in this external environment.
When external code calls the <code>ActorSystem()</code> constructor, an
ActorSystem is started if one is not already running.
</p>

<p>
An argument may be passed to the <a href="#sec-1-3">ActorSystem</a> constructor to specify
the systemBase (a.k.a ActorSystem implementation) that should be used
for starting the ActorSystem if one is not already running; if an
ActorSystem is already running, this argument is ignored.  If no
argument is specified and no ActorSystem is running, the default
<a href="#sec-9-2">simpleSystemBase</a> ActorSystem will be started.

<h3 id="sec-9-1"><span class="section-number-3">9.1</span> Common Capabilities</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-1">
<p>
As described in <a href="#sec-4-10">ActorSystem Capabilities</a> each ActorSystem has a set of
capabilities that describe that ActorSystem and which can be audited
by the Actor's <a href="#sec-5-12">actorSystemCapabilityCheck</a> method to determine if the
Actor is compatible with the ActorSystem.  Many capabilities can be
set when the ActorSystem is started (see <a href="#sec-1-3">ActorSystem</a>), or updated at
run-time (see <a href="#sec-5-13">updateCapability</a> for either the Actor or the ActorSystem
API); those marked <i>read-only</i> below may only be viewed, but not set
or changed when the ActorSystem is started.
</p>

<p>
Each ActorSystem may specify capabilities unique to that ActorSystem
and the application can add capabilities to that ActorSystem; in
addition, the following common capabilities are defined for all
ActorSystems:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <b>Python Version</b> </dt><dd><i>read-only</i> This is set to the tuple value of the Python
version under which the ActorSystem is running (this is the same
value supplied by <code>sys.version_info</code>).  Any Actors wishing to
enforce any version restrictions use this capability to do so.
</dd>

<dt> <b>Thespian Generation</b> </dt><dd><i>read-only</i> This is the Thespian API functionality
specifier as a tuple of two values: <code>(generation, enhancement)</code>.
The first value is the <code>generation</code> and indicates a major
functionality level (which is not necessarily backwards-compatible
with the previous functionality level).  The second number is the
<code>enhancement</code> value and is incremented when backwards-compatible
functional enhancements have been added within the current
<code>generation</code>.  The <code>generation</code> value is monotonically increasing,
whereas the <code>enhancement</code> value monotonically increases within a
<code>generation</code> but resets to zero when the generation changes. The
Thespian Release Notes should be consulted to determine what
features are supported in what generations.

<p>
This value is also available to current code in the <code>thespian.api</code>
import as the <code>ThespianGeneration</code> value; if this local value is
different than the ActorSystem provides in the capabilities
</p>
</dd>

<dt> <b>Thespian Version</b> </dt><dd><i>read-only</i> This is the identifier for the version of
Thespian running in the current environment.  This is a single
numeric value where later releases will have a higher (but not
necessarily successor) value.
</dd>

<dt> <b>Thespian ActorSystem Name</b> </dt><dd><i>read-only</i> This is the name of the running
ActorSystem implementation.  It is encouraged that Actors are not
written to be unique to any particular implementation, but this
information is present to allow ActorSystem-specific capability
verification.
</dd>

<dt> <b>Thespian ActorSystem Version</b> </dt><dd><i>read-only</i> This is the ActorSystem version
as a single numeric value (similar to the <code>Thespian Version</code>
capability.  This value may be incremented separately from the
<code>Thespian Version</code> to indicate an update in the underlying
ActorSystem implementation.  The value of a specific ActorSystem
will increment, but different ActorSystems have different version
namespaces and switching from one to another does not guarantee
that the ActorSystem version will increment.
</dd>

<dt> <b>AllowRemoteActorSources</b> </dt><dd>This capability specifies whether or
not this ActorSystem will accept sources loaded via remote
ActorSystems as described in the <a href="#sec-4-14">Actor Code Distribution</a>
section.  Valid values for this capability are:

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <b>Yes</b> </dt><dd>Any Actor Source validated by a Source Authority
on a remote system can be run on this system as
well (this is the default).
</dd>

<dt> <b>No</b> </dt><dd>No Actor Sources from remote systems will be accepted locally.
</dd>

<dt> <b>LeaderOnly</b> </dt><dd>Only Actor Sources provided by the
Convention Leader will be accepted locally.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Any unrecognized value will be treated as <b>No</b> and will
disallow sources loaded on remote systems to be used in the
current ActorSystem.  If this capability is not specified, the
default is <b>Yes</b> which will accept sources loaded on any of the
remote ActorSystems that are part of the Convention.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<div id="outline-container-sec-9-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-9-2"><span class="section-number-3">9.2</span> simpleSystemBase</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-2">
<p>
The simpleSystemBase implementation is primarily designed for Unit
Testing and other very simplistic Actor environments:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All Actors run synchronously in the context of the current
process thread.
</li>
<li>It is possible for an Actor to modify global state referenced by
other Actors (as a matter of principal, accessing global state
is an anti-pattern for the Actor Model).
</li>
<li>It is possible for an Actor to modify the caller's version of
the message (see <i>Message Mutability</i>).
</li>
<li>The <a href="#sec-5-12">actorSystemCapabilityCheck</a> is not called for any Actors: all
actors are created in the current ActorSystem regardless of
their capability requirements.
</li>
<li>No support for <a href="#sec-1-3-2">Multiple Systems</a> (e.g. Conventions)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Specifically, whenever an ActorSystem <code>.tell()</code> or <code>.ask()</code> is
called, the message is passed to the target Actor and any subsequent
actorCreate or message sends performed by that Actor are run in
sequence, etc. recursively.  When the <code>.tell()</code> or <code>.ask()</code>
completes back to the caller, most messages have been propagated
through the system and it has reached equilibrium.
</p>

<p>
There is one exception to the equilibrium state: pending <a href="#sec-5-5">wakeupAfter</a>
wakeups.  These wakups may still be pending when the <code>.tell()</code> or
<code>.ask()</code> returns, and will not be delivered in the background
subsequent to that return.  If the wakeup time period expires during
a future call to <code>.tell()</code> or <code>.ask()</code> then the <code>WakeupMessage</code> will
be delivered at that point.  Wakeup periods that expire in the
interim are not acted upon until a future <code>.tell()</code> or <code>.ask()</code>, and
if no future calls of this type are made then those wakeups are
never delivered.
</p>

<p>
The simpleSystemBase is commonly used for unit testing
configurations; as such, specifying the <code>logDefs</code> constructor
argument as <code>False</code> helps prevent this system base from interfering
with any log capturing that is performed by the unit testing
framework (e.g. nosetest logcapture).

<h3 id="sec-9-3"><span class="section-number-3">9.3</span> multiprocQueueBase</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-3">
<p>
The multiprocQueueBase runs each Actor in its own separate process
for a truly asynchronous system.  The default Actor communication
method is by utilizing multiprocess Queue objects.  The Actors are
constrained to the current system, which is unique to the starting
process. There is no inter-system communications possible, nor sharing
of the ActorSystem with processes that are siblings of the starting
process (i.e. not started by the ActorSystem itself).
</p>

<p>
The multiprocQueueBase System Base is used between all processes
that were created from the original creation of the SystemBase, but a
new SystemBase is created by each initiating process and the Queues
are unique between the different SystemBase elements.  The lifetime of
the ActorSystem is limited to the lifetime of the process that
created it.
</p>

<p>
The multiprocQueueBase uses Python's multiprocess Queue objects, but
due to the fact that these Queues can only be passed by direct process
inheritance and not via pickling, this system base can be somewhat
inefficent due to the manner in which this implementation must route
messages through a chain of actor processes from source to
destination.
</p>

<p>
The multiprocQueueBase can only be used for communications on the
current system and not for inter-system communications.  The
multiprocQueueBase does not support the use of multiple ActorSystems
in a Convention as described in <a href="#sec-1-3-2">Multiple Systems</a>.
</p>

<p>
The multiprocQueueBase uses the following <a href="#sec-4-10">ActorSystem Capabilities</a>:

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <b>Thespian ActorSystem Name</b> </dt><dd><i>read-only</i> "multiprocQueueBase"

arbitrary string value; the default is 'ThespianQ'.
</dd>

<dt> <b>Process Startup Method</b> </dt><dd><i>optional</i> specifies the
multiprocessing process startup method (see
<code>multiprocessing.get_context()</code>).  Supported values are "fork"
and "spawn".  The "spawn" method is generally slower because it
creates each new process from scratch, but it provides better
independence and isolation.  The "fork" method is faster but
can inherit memory and other resources from the parent, and it
is only available under Unix.  Note that the other
multi-process bases support the multiprocessing "forkserver"
method, but this multiprocQueueBase does not support the
"forkserver" method.

<p>
The multiprocTCPBase runs each Actor in its own separate process

method is by utilizing TCP socket connections.
</p>

<p>
The multiprocTCP SystemBase is shared between all processes that
utilize the same Administrator coordinates, and can be used for
inter-system communications.  The lifetime of the ActorSystem exceeds
that of the process that started it and persists until an explicit
shutdown.
</p>

<p>
The multiprocTCPBase can be used for Actors on the same system or on
other systems accessible via TCP/IPv4.
</p>

<p>
The multiprocTCPBase supports forwarding of logging messages (warning
and above) to the Convention Leader if used in a multi-system
configuration.
</p>

<p>
The multiprocTCPBase uses the following <a href="#sec-4-10">ActorSystem Capabilities</a>:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <b>Thespian ActorSystem Name</b> </dt><dd><i>read-only</i> "multiprocTCPBase"
</dd>

<dt> <b>Admin Port</b> </dt><dd>which specifies the TCP port number upon which the
ActorSystem will listen for new communications.  Actors and the
external systems do not need to access that port specifically:
it specifies which port the ActorSystem uses internally for
coordination of operations.

<p>
If a multiprocTCPBase ActorSystem is already listening at that
port, then the existing system will be utilized; otherwise a new
multiprocTCPBase ActorSystem will be started up.
</p>

<p>
If not specified, the default Admin Port of 1900 is used.
</p>
</dd>

<dt> <b>Convention Address.IPv4</b> </dt><dd>the IPv4 address of the convention
leader's Admin.  This should be specified either as a tuple of
<i>(hostname, portnum)</i> or as a string of the form
"hostname:portnum".  The hostname may be a DNS name or a dotted
quad IPv4 address (specified as a string) and references the
host on which the Convention Leader Admin is to be found.  The
portnum is the <b>Admin Port</b> upon which that Admin listens; if
not specified (no colon is found) then the port num defaults to
the <b>Admin Port</b> setting.
</dd>

<dt> <b>Admin Routing</b> </dt><dd>if this capability is present and has a true
value, this indicates that all Actors in remote ActorSystems
must send all messages to local Actors through the Admin.  This
is commonly used where the ActorSystem is running on a host
node that has a firewall that only allows the Admin Port to
have network ingress permissions.  

<p>
Note that this capability has no effect on the way in which the
Actors themselves are implemented; it only changes the way that
the ActorSystem routes messages.
</p>
</dd>

<dt> <b>Outbound Only</b> </dt><dd>if this capability is present and has a true
value then it means that this ActorSystem (and all of the
Actors within it) can only initiate outbound connections.
Inbound connections are not supported.

<p>
This configuration may be needed for a system that is behind a
firewall with very strict ingress rules but looser egress
rules.
</p>

<p>
Specifying this capability as True will implicitly force "Admin
Routing" to be true as well, regardless of the user setting.
This is because it is impractical for this system to maintain
outbound connections to all possible remote Actors, so it will
maintain a persistent connection to other Admins only and
forward packets via them using the "Admin Routing"
functionality.
</p>

<p>
In addition, this system will not be able to join in
conventions with other systems unless the other systems are
declared via the <code>preRegisterRemoteSystem()</code> call, since they
cannot initiate an inbound registration to this system.
</p>

<p>
Remote systems may encounter periodic delays in message
forwarding messages to an Outbound Only system because they
must await a connection establishment from that system (which
may not occur until the next Convention Registration time
period has elapsed).  (This mode also requires socket re-use by
the TCP transport, which is the normal operational mode).
</p>
</dd>

<dt> <b>Thespian Watch Supported</b> </dt><dd><i>read-only</i> If True, then an Actor
may return the <code>ThespianWatch</code> object from its <code>receiveMessage()</code>
method and be called back later when input is available on any
of the numbered file descriptors passed in the <code>ThespianWatch</code>
object.
</dd>

<dt> <b>Process Startup Method</b> </dt><dd><i>optional</i> specifies the
multiprocessing process startup method (see
<code>multiprocessing.get_context()</code>).  Supported values are "fork",
"forkserver", and "spawn".  The "spawn" method is generally
slower because it creates each new process from scratch, but it
provides better independence and isolation.  The "fork" method
is faster but can inherit memory and other resources from the
parent, and it is only available under Unix.    The "forkserver"
performance is between the other two, but closer to the
performance of the "spawn" method.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-5">
<p>
The multiprocUDPBase runs each Actor in its own separate process

The multiprocUDP SystemBase is shared between all processes that
utilize the same Administrator coordinates, and can be used for
inter-system communications.  The lifetime of the ActorSystem

</p>

<p>
As with most UDP-based exchanges, there is no guarantee that messages
have been delivered.  One effect of this is that it is often difficult
for the ActorSystem to recognize that Actors have exited and so Dead
Letter delivery is unreliable at best for this system base.

Additionally, the UDP-based ActorSystem can only exchange messages up
to 64KiB in size.  Larger messages will fail.

The former method is a simpler method, but it means that the

<p>
Using the latter method is slightly more complicated from a

differences between in-process and multi-process ActorSystems:
unloaded sources are still present in still-existing multi-process
